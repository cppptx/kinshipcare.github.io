Delia and her husband have been raising their three grandchildren since the kids were toddlers. To deal with the economic hardship of caring for the kids so late in their life, the San Antonio couple applied for numerous state programs. She was told she didn’t qualify. So instead of repairing her house, Delia had to retire early and use her savings to help take care of her grandchildren. 
<br>
<br>
Before she retired, Delia worked with an organization that helps children navigate the court system when performing community service. Many of these children had been thrown out of their homes by their parents and were being cared for by their grandparents. 
<br>
<br>
Like many "kinship care" providers, one of the biggest obstacles that these grandparents face is a lack of information about the resources that are available to them. Delia says she wants to work with schools to help get information to kinship care providers that need it.</p>

<p class="text-justify">As an advocate, Delia and her friend run Abuelos y Nietos Juntos, a kinship care support group in San Antonio
“I had a grandmother tell me, ‘I need your help because I’ve been on a waiting list for my grandkids to see a psychiatrist. My 12-year-old boy has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and has depression, and my 11-year-old daughter has mood swings.’ Both had been waiting to see a psychiatrist for over three years. 
<br>
<br>
Working with Delia, the Center for Public Policy Priorities plays an important role in bringing people together to find the resources that they need. 
“I am a beginner at this,” says Delia. “Because of what happened in my life I decided to become an advocate. But you guys know better than I do who are the people we need to be talking to.”
